# Observer pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (Subject) changes state, 
all its dependents (Observers) are notified and updated automatically.

In the example com.designPatterns.behavior.observer. NewsAgency is the main class implementing Subject.
And contains list of observers.
