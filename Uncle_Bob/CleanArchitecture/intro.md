## Goal of clean architecture

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system.

The measure of design quality is simply the measure of the effort required to meet the needs of the customer. 
If that effort is low, and stays low throughout the lifetime of the system, the design is good. 
If that effort grows with each new release, the design is bad. It’s as simple as that.

Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders: **behavior and structure.**
    Software developers are responsible for ensuring that both those values remain high. Unfortunately, they often 
    focus on one to the exclusion of the other.

If architecture comes last, then the system will become ever more costly to develop, and eventually change will become 
practically impossible for part or all of the system.

The dilemma for software developers is that business managers are not equipped to evaluate the importance of 
architecture. 
    That's what software developers were hired to do. Therefore it is the responsibility of the software development 
team to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features."
