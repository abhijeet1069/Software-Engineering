# Emergence

## Getting clean via emergent designs

If we follow below principles, then good design starts to emerge

- Runs all the tests
- Contains no duplication
- Expresses the intent of the programmer
- Minimizes the number of classes and methods

It is not enough for code to work. Code that works is often badly broken. Programmers
who satisfy themselves with merely working code are behaving unprofessionally. They
may fear that they don’t have time to improve the structure and design of their code, but I
disagree. Nothing has a more profound and long-term degrading effect upon a development
project than bad code. 
	Bad schedules can be redone, bad requirements can be redefined.
Bad team dynamics can be repaired. But bad code rots and ferments, becoming an
inexorable weight that drags the team down. Time and time again I have seen teams grind
to a crawl because, in their haste, they created a malignant morass of code that forever
thereafter dominated their destiny.
