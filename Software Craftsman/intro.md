# Software Craftsmanship

Software craftsmanship is a long journey to mastery. It's a mindset where software developers choose to be responsible 
for their own careers, constantly learning new tools and techniques and constantly bettering themselves. 
Software craftsmanship is all about putting responsibility, professionalism, pragmatism and pride back into software 
development.

Making things work is the minimum I expect from someone who is paid for it.

How it is done is as important as getting it done.

Real engineers are not divided into "DSA people" and "API people". This is a false dichotomy many developers believe 
early in their journey. Reality:
a) Strong engineers know algorithms and
b) Build real systems (APIs, services, tools, architecture)
Both are needed, because both solve different parts of real problem.

The day we stop learning and practicing is the
day we start losing control of our careers. The more knowledge and skills we have, the easier it is to own our 
careers—that
means we are able to choose where, when, and for whom to work, and how much to charge for our services.

## Seniority

Over the years, I learned that seniority is transient and relative. 
     It is transient because clients will demand different
types of systems as technology evolves. Having fifteen years of experience working with Clipper in a traditional 
waterfallfashion will not get me a senior position in a modern company developing mobile applications in an Agile 
fashion.

Seniority is also relative. When trying to identify how senior a developer is, we need to ask ourselves the following questions: senior compared to whom? In which technology? In which context?
    There is no such thing as a senior or junior developer. Developers may be very experienced in developing enterprise
Java applications for large organizations but totally inexperienced in writing games in JavaScript.

## Ignorance

Ignorance is the single greatest impediment to throughput, meaning that if we reduce the level of our ignorance as
fast as we can, we can be far more productive and and efficient.
