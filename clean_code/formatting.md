# Formatting

Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the professional developer’s first order of business.

## Size of a class

A class can be typically 200 lines long, with an upper limit of 500.

## Variable declaration

Declare variables as close as possible to their first use.

- It improves readability: when you encounter the variable declaration, you immediately 
	see why it's being created.

- It reduces the scope of the variable to the minimum necessary, making the code easier to 
	reason about and less prone to bugs.

Variables and function should be defined close to where they are used. Local variables
should be declared just above their first usage and should have a small vertical scope. We
don’t want local variables declared hundreds of lines distant from their usages.

Private functions should be defined just below their first usage. Private functions
belong to the scope of the whole class, but we’d still like to limit the vertical distance
between the invocations and definitions. Finding a private function should just be a matter
of scanning downward from the first usage.

## Instance variables

Instance variable should be declared at the top of the class.

## Dependent functions

If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all 
possible. This gives the program a natural flow. Also, This creates a nice flow down the source code module from high 
level to low level.

```javascript

function main() {
    processInput();
    calculateResult();
    displayOutput();
}

function processInput() {
    // ...
}

function calculateResult() {
    // ...
}

function displayOutput() {
    // ...
}

```

## Width of a line

100-120 characters in a line is good.

## Breaking Indentation

We shouldn't break the indentation of the code even for short if statement or short functions etc. Its tempting but
to break the indentation but should be avoided.

## Team Rules

A team of developers should agree upon a single formatting style, and then every member of that team should use that 
style. We want the software to have a consistent style. We don’t want it to appear to have been written by a bunch of
disagreeing individuals.
